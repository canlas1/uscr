><FONT size="2"></B>As a public service, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prepared the following complete text of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. &sect; 1681 et seq. Although staff generally followed the format of the U.S. Code as published by the Government Printing Office, the format of this text does differ in minor ways from the Code (and from West&rsquo;s </P
><P 

>U.S. Code Annotated). For example, this version uses FCRA section numbers (&sect;&sect; 601-625) in the headings. (The relevant U.S. Code citation is included with each section heading and each reference to the FCRA in the text.) Although the staff has made every effort to transcribe the statutory material accurately, this compendium is intended only as a convenience for the public and not a subtitute for the text in the U. S. Code. This document was posted on July 30, 2004. </P

In other cases, the FACT Act provides that the effective dates be prescribed by the FTC and Federal Reserve Board. See 16 CFR Part 602. (69 Fed. Reg. 6526; February 11, 2004) (69 Fed.

Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change. </P
