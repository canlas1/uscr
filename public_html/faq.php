        	<br />  <p><strong><a name="faq_sue" id="faq_sue"></a>Can My Creditor Sue Me? What If I Get A Judgment? </strong><br />
       	     It is a reality you could be sued.  That is why you should consult a lawyer and get legal advice and possible representation.  US Credit Relief is not a law firm.  Although, we cannot provide you with legal advice or representation, US Credit Relief works with a large network of attorneys in every state in which we do business.  Often we may be able to refer you to one of our attorneys for little or no cost depending on the specific situation. A creditor can use legal action to get money that is owed to them.  If you don't pay them, you violate the terms you agreed to with them.  Our track record is excellent.  With past clients, we have settled summons, complaints and accounts with judgments. Our job is to negotiate for you and find the best resolution possible.</p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_thinking" id="faq_thinking"></a><strong>I'm Thinking About Settling My Own Debt. Can I do this? </strong><br />
       	      Sure you could.  But more than likely, we could save you more money.  We are professional debt negotiators and have stellar relationships with many major creditors.  We have industry knowledge and are trained to use negotiation strategies that will give you the best settlement possible.  It would seem like hiring someone to help you with this type of service would cost you more money.  But in reality, our clients find that when we do the negotiating and their debt is paid off, they have more money in their pockets.</p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_slamming" id="faq_slamming"></a><strong>My Creditors Are Slamming Me With Interest, Fees And Penalties. Can you stop this? </strong><br />
       	     Until a settlement is reached with your creditors, they can legally continue to charge you interest, late fees and penalties.  If you don't make your minimum payments, a creditor can (and usually does) raise your interest rate, dragging you further into debt.  Your account balance continues to grow, while your creditor tacks on accrued interest, late fees, over-the-limit fees and penalties.  Keep in mind if we can't successfully negotiate an agreement with your creditor, you will have to pay the entire balance.  That's why you shouldn't wait and contact us today.  We have successfully helped people eliminate their debt.  </p>
        	  <p><strong><a name="faq_tax" id="faq_tax"></a>You Could Save Me A Lot Of Money. Will I Have To Pay Taxes On What I Save? </strong><br />
       	      After you settle your debt, the amount of money you saved could be reported as income to the IRS.  Anytime you save more than $600 on a debt, the savings could be reported to the IRS and show up as a "Discharge of Indebtedness".  US Credit Relief is not a tax preparer, CPA or tax attorney.  One of these professionals could give you a better idea on these types of potential taxes.  You may also go to the IRS website and download their related publications. </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_settle" id="faq_settle"></a><strong>Do I Have To Settle All My Debts? </strong><br />
       	      No.  If you want to keep an account open, you can do so without settling that debt.  Then, you can use that account in the future.  If you owe a lot of money on an account, we do suggest that you settle that account to avoid paying a lot of money over time to that creditor.</p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_negotiate" id="faq_negotiate"></a><strong>Will You Negotiate My Interest Rates, Fees &amp; Penalties? </strong><br />
       	     We are a one-stop-shop.  We will negotiate everything you owe and that includes interest, fees and/or penalties.  It's our job to get you the lowest settlement possible.</p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_cc" id="faq_cc"></a><strong>Is Debt Negotiation Only Good For Credit Card Debt? </strong><br />
       	     We can help you with most kinds of unsecured debt.  This includes credit cards, medical bills, legal invoices, retail/department store accounts, collections and personal loans.  There are some debts that we can't help you with, such as IRS tax liens, federal student loans, child support, alimony, mortgages, auto loans and any type of secured debt. </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_difference" id="faq_difference"></a><strong>What Is The Difference Between Debt Settlement &amp; Debt Consolidation? </strong><br />
       	      Debt settlement is reducing the amount of debt owed by negotiating a lower total amount with your creditors.  On the other hand, debt consolidation transfers your full debt amount to another loan.  This does not reduce what you owe, but reduces your interest rates and minimum payments.  This can be more costly and leave you and your finances wide open to some serious issues.  Additionally, debt consolidation often claim to be "non-profit", but they are often funded by and working for your creditors, while charging you fees for their services.  US Credit Relief works for you!  We can cut your debt in half, get your payments down to an amount you can afford and get you debt free faster. </p>
        	  <p><strong><a name="faq_how" id="faq_how"></a>How Does Debt Settlement Work? </strong><br />
       	      We set up a program that is based on you setting money aside and letting us negotiate the best settlement for you and your situation.  Once you are officially enrolled in our program, US Credit Relief contacts your creditors.  You continue to put funds in your settlement account (we call it saving).  We send settlement offers to your creditors.  As long as you continue to save (according to the program we've established with you), you will get the best settlement possible.  Once a settlement is reached with a creditor, we contact you and let you know.  If you approve, it's a go.  This process continues with each creditor until all your debts are settled.  A typical settlement program takes 12 to 48 months.  The length of time depends on how much you owe and how much you save monthly towards your debt.  When we forecast what you will save, the percentages reflect what you will save at the time of settlement and illustrate the typical amount our clients have saved on settled accounts.  We can't guarantee a creditor will accept any specific settlement offer.  The length of time that our service takes and the settlement results may vary per individual case. </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_expect" id="faq_expect"></a><strong>How Much Of My Debt Can I Expect To Be Settled By Your Program? </strong><br />
       	      Each creditor has their own criteria to decide if they are willing to settle the debt and for how much.  This includes the amount of the debt, the debt's current status, reasons you want to settle it, the type of debt and how much disposable income you have.</p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_quick" id="faq_quick"></a><strong>How Quickly Will My Debt Be Gone? </strong><br />
       	      The amount of time it takes to pay off each account varies.  Many factors are at play in determining how long it will take.  The outstanding balance, number of accounts that are being settled and the amount you can pay towards your accounts monthly are some of the factors.  We design your program specifically for you and it's based on how our debt negotiation specialists can help you best upon reviewing your financial situation.  The average length of time most of our customers pay off the balance of their accounts is 12 to 48 months.  It may take you less or more time to pay off your balance.</p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_score" id="faq_score"></a><strong>What About My Credit Score? </strong><br />
       	      US Credit Relief does not control your credit rating.  Your credit score could be affected while you are in our program.  This could cause negative credit information to be reported to credit reporting agencies and on your credit record.  Unpaid debts or debts that are settled for less than the full amount you owe can also cause a mark on your credit report.  If you do receive a negative credit mark, you agree to waive US Credit Relief and its principles harmless from current and/or future damages or claims.  A settled account will improve your debt to income ratio and should reflect positively on your credit record.  After you complete the program, we suggest that you consult with a third party credit restoration group to get rid of any inaccuracies on your credit report.  </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_cost" id="faq_cost"></a><strong>How Much Is This Going To Cost Me? </strong><br />
        	    Payment plans are custom tailored to each individual and the payments you make each month depend on your circumstance and debt accrued.  Our service fees for debt reduction services vary on the amount you owe and how long you're on the actual program.  Before you enter our program, we give you an estimate of what your fees will be over the course of the program period.  The fees we charge are small compared to how much you will save off your current balances overall, in contrast to paying any recurring interest charges currently applicable to your credit card accounts and other debts every month for the distant future, not to mention any applicable late fees and penalties you may face.  We want you to get ahead and regain control of your finances.</p>

        	  <p><a name="faq_bankruptcy" id="faq_bankruptcy"></a><strong>I'm Thinking About Filing For Bankruptcy. Is This A Good Idea? </strong><br />
       	    We can't advise you on what to do with respect to bankruptcy.  This is a personal decision and we recommend you speak with a bankruptcy attorney.  In order to file bankruptcy, you must meet certain criteria.  In 2005, new laws took effect making it more difficult to file for bankruptcy and be freed of all your debt.  The American Bankruptcy Institute has provided general guidelines to help consumers who are considering bankruptcy and how it may benefit them. Here is a summary of their guidelines: </p>
        	  <ul>
				  <li>Your bank account has been       attached</li>
				  <li>The bulk of your debt is       unsecured like credit cards or medical bills </li>
				  <li>Your total debt, not       including what you owe on your car or house loans, is more than you could       ever pay in five years or more </li>
				  <li>Collection agencies are       calling you </li>
				  <li>You are 30 days or more       behind on more than one bill </li>
				  <li>You have lawsuits pending       against you </li>
				  <li>You have high medical bills       that aren't covered by your insurance </li>
				  <li>You owe income tax that you       can't pay </li>
				  <li>You don't have many assets </li>
				  <li>You have little or no money       saved </li>
				  <li>You have had a repossession,       such as a vehicle </li>
        	  </ul>
        	  <p><a name="faq_explain" id="faq_explain"></a><strong>Can You Explain What Debt Settlement Is? </strong><br />
       	     Debt settlement is a negotiation process with major creditors.  The end result is to reduce your debt as easily as possible with a program that meets your individual needs.  We have reduced many customers debt by 50%* or more over 12 to 48 months. </p>
<p>*We can't promise that we will reduce your personal debt by 50%.  This is our estimate for the amount typically saved by our clients.  Savings vary by individual and don't reflect service fees.  Additionally, US Credit Relief can't guarantee that any creditor will accept any specific settlement offer. Settlement savings results and the length of time required to fully satisfy any settlements may vary.
</p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_difference2" id="faq_difference2"></a><strong>What's The Difference Between Secured &amp; Unsecured Debt? </strong><br />
       	     Unsecured debt doesn't involve assets and is a promise to pay a creditor.  Typical examples of unsecured debt are credit cards, personal loans, and medical bills.</p>
<p>Secured debt is backed by an asset or collateral, like a house or automobile.  Your mortgage is an example of secured deb.  If you fall behind on payments, the lender can foreclose on your house.  An auto loan would be another example, as your car could be repossessed if you fail to make payments. 
 </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_join" id="faq_join"></a><strong>I Want to Join Your Program. What Are The Requirements? </strong><br />
       	     Our clients have past due unsecured debts such as credit card bills, at least $7,500 worth of debt and are experiencing overwhelming financial hardships, high monthly minimum payments or simply cannot afford their debt.  They've considered bankruptcy, but decided debt reduction is the way to go and their best option to get out of their current situation and back on track with their financial situation. </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_collection" id="faq_collection"></a><strong>Can You Stop The Collection Calls? </strong><br />
       	     We can't promise they will stop.  We do suggest that you write a letter to your collectors telling them to stop contacting you.  This should stop them from frequently calling after they receive the letter, except to tell you there will be no further action or that they intend to take specific action against you.  Keep in mind that sending them a letter doesn't make your debt go away and the collection agency or original creditor can sue you. </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_creditors" id="faq_creditors"></a><strong>Will My Creditors Work With You? </strong><br />
       	     US Credit Relief has worked with all of the major creditors and has built solid relationships with them.  In most cases, creditors want to settle so they can recover part of the money you owe them in a reasonable amount of time, rather than little or nothing. </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_debt" id="faq_debt"></a><strong>What Kinds Of Debt Do You Settle? </strong><br />
       	      We only handle unsecured debt, such as credit cards, medical bills, retail/department store credit cards, collection accounts and personal loans.  We can't help you with secured debt such as mortgages and auto loans, as well as IRS liens, federal student loans, child support or alimony. </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_debt2" id="faq_debt2"></a><strong>Is Debt Negotiation Only For Credit Cards? </strong><br />
       	      We can help you with credit cards and more, such as medical and legal bills, retail/department store cards, accounts gone to collection and personal loans. We can't assist you with secured debt such as IRS tax liens, student loans, child support, alimony, mortgages, auto loans or any property that can be repossessed. </p>
        	  <p><a name="faq_privacy" id="faq_privacy"></a><strong>Do You Give Or Sell My Information To Anyone? </strong><br />
       	    US Credit Relief will sign a confidentially agreement with you when you enter the program, stating that your personal information will only be released when necessary to settle your accounts.  We do not sell or release your information to any third parties.  It is the law that we have to keep all of our clients' information private. </p>
